# IOT-BASED-WATER-QUALITY-MONITORING-SYSTEM
“An autonomous IoT-based system to ensure safe rural water supply. Water from rivers/dams is stored in a common tank and distributed to three village tanks. Sensors with ESP32 check purity (pH, turbidity, TDS, temperature). If impure, servo valves divert water for re-purification and alerts are sent instantly.”
